"# constraint-layout-2.0.0-beta2-bug" 

In Constraintlayout 2.0.0-beta1 the layout was showing correctly. When I update to 2.0.0-beta2 the list items are not shown anymore in the device. 

Ps. In my "real" project I have some ads loading in the bottom of the screen. 
After a while they update, causing a new layout pass to happen. 
Then the list items in the Scrollview are shown again...?

Change the version in app to see the problem
